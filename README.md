# rpi_7segment8digit-display_max7219
deleted and reinitilzes



the code I had was scrolling text and other cool manipulations of 7segment8digits display. sounds rgeat i know. 

here is what i remember so far:

print and change brightness with timers in between.
or JUST PLAIN CODE: SPAM show-writes to display SPI port, and have MINI-SLEEP TIMERS in between ALSO reSPAMMING the brightness LEVel SPI function. To create 1 SET of ANIMATION.

2nd SET OF ANIMATION is SCROLLING TEXT..

3rd SET OF ANIMATION IS MAKING TEST like Sound, up and down Viszualizer and others.

4. was to complete CHESS timer system with Game Engine CHess System.

5. Undo anyway, but Done and Saved in  get IP address from linux cmd. and other CPU temp and speed stats from computer. perf mini pro tests.

6. sad lost lots of C code and python code that does alot of this.
